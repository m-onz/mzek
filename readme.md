# `mzek`

An experimental p2p IDS and monitoring system built on a bleeding edge p2p protocol: secure scuttlebutt.

## `overview`

This is an experiment in using a custom [secure scuttlebutt](https://handbook.scuttlebutt.nz/guides/ssb-server-context) network to monitor and
 maintain a cluster of linux machines (testing on debian only so far).

This is being actively developed now so don't use it yet.. come back soon!
